:description: ownCloud can be installed using the official ownCloud Docker image.

== Introduction

{description} This {dockerhub-url}[official image] works standalone for a quick evaluation but is designed to be used in a docker-compose setup.

== Database Notes

With the image provided, ownCloud has added database connectors for the following databases:

* MySQL / MariaDB
* Postgres
* SQLite

If you need a different connector or a different version of a connector, you have to manually create your own image based on the ownCloud image provided here. This could also be done directly in the {docker-compose-build-url}[docker compose file].

== Getting Started

Grant docker command privileges to certain users by adding them to the group `docker`:

[source,bash]
----
sudo usermod -aG docker <your-user>
----

[NOTE]
====
The changes via `usermod` only take effect after the docker users log in. So you may have to log out and log in again or possibly reboot before you can run docker commands.
====

Users not added to the `docker` group can run docker commands with a preceding `sudo`. In this section `sudo` is generally omitted before docker commands since we assume you have created a docker user, which is also the only way to run ownCloud's command-line interface `occ` in a docker container. For more information on `occ`, see section xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[Using the occ Command].

An example `occ` command looks like this:

[source,docker]
----
docker exec --user www-data <owncloud-container-name> occ <your-command>
----

== Quick Evaluation

NOTE: The commands and links provided in the following descriptions are intended to showcase basic docker usage, but we cannot take responsibility for their proper functioning.
If you only want to take a peek using your local machine and are content with SQLite as database, which is not supported by ownCloud for production purposes, try the following:

[source,docker,subs="attributes+"]
----
docker run --rm --name oc-eval -d -p{std-port-http}:{std-port-http} owncloud/server
----

This starts a docker container with the name "oc-eval" in the background (option `-d`). `owncloud/server` is the docker image downloaded from Docker Hub. If you don't start the container with option `-d`, the logs will be displayed in the shell. If you are running it in the background as in the example above, you can display the logs with the command:

[source,docker]
----
docker logs oc-eval
----

With the command `docker ps` you can list your running docker containers and should see the entry for oc-eval.

You can log in to your ownCloud instance via a browser at `pass:a[http://localhost:{std-port-http}]` with the preconfigured user `admin` and password `admin`.

NOTE: Access only works locally with http, not https.

Now, if you like what you see but want a supported installation with MariaDB, you should remove the eval version before proceeding with the next section.

[source,docker]
----
docker kill oc-eval
----

This removes the container if you used the option `--rm` as suggested in the example above. If you omitted that option, you need to first run the command:

[source,docker]
----
docker rm oc-eval
----

If you now run `docker ps` again, the entry for oc-eval should be gone.

== Docker Compose

The configuration:

* Exposes ports {std-port-http}, allowing for HTTP connections.
* Uses separate _MariaDB_ and _Redis_ containers.
* Mounts the data and MySQL data directories on the host for persistent storage.

The following instructions assume you install locally. For remote access, the value of xref:configuration/server/config_sample_php_parameters.adoc#override-cli-url[OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN] and xref:configuration/server/config_sample_php_parameters.adoc#define-list-of-trusted-domains-that-users-can-log-into[OWNCLOUD_TRUSTED_DOMAINS] must be updated to represent the hostname(s) and/or IP addresses that the server is reachable at.

. Create a new project directory.
+
--
[source,bash]
----
mkdir owncloud-docker-server
cd owncloud-docker-server
----
--

. Then copy and paste the sample `docker-compose.yml` as base to derive from:
+
--
[source,yml]
----
include::example$installation/docker/docker-compose.yml[]
----
--

. Create a `.env` configuration file, which contains the required configuration settings.
+
--
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
cat << EOF > .env
OWNCLOUD_VERSION={latest-server-version}
OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN=localhost:{std-port-http}
OWNCLOUD_TRUSTED_DOMAINS=localhost
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
HTTP_PORT={std-port-http}
EOF
----

Only a few settings are required, these are:

[width="100%",cols="45%,50%,80%",options="header"]
|===
| Setting Name
| Description
| Example

| `OWNCLOUD_VERSION`
| The ownCloud version
| `latest`

| `OWNCLOUD_DOMAIN`
| The ownCloud domain
| `localhost:{std-port-http}`

| `OWNCLOUD_TRUSTED_DOMAINS`
| The ownCloud trusted domains
| `localhost`

| `ADMIN_USERNAME`
| The admin username
| `admin`

| `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
| The admin userâ€™s password
| `admin`

| `HTTP_PORT`
| The HTTP port to bind to
| `{std-port-http}`
|===

NOTE: `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` will not change between deploys even if you change the
values in the .env file. To change them, you'll need to do `docker volume prune`, which
*will delete all your data*.
--

. Then, you can build and start the container, using your preferred Docker _command-line tool_.
+
--
The example below shows how to use {docker-compose-url}[Docker Compose].

[source,docker]
----
docker-compose up -d
----
--

. When the process completes:
+
--
Check that all the containers have successfully started, by running `docker-compose ps`. If they are all working correctly, you should see output similar to the one below:

[width="100%",cols="30%,50%,30%,50%",options="header"]
|===
| Name
| Command
| State
| Ports

| owncloud_mariadb
| docker-entrypoint.sh --max ...
| Up (healthy)
| {std-port-mysql}/tcp

| owncloud_redis
| docker-entrypoint.sh --dat ...
| Up (healthy)
| {std-port-redis}/tcp

| owncloud_server
| /usr/bin/entrypoint /usr/b ...
| Up (healthy)
| 0.0.0.0:{std-port-http}->{std-port-http}/tcp
|===

In it, you can see that the database, ownCloud and Redis containers are running, and that ownCloud
is accessible via port {std-port-http} on the host machine.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All files stored in this setup are contained in Docker volumes rather than a physical filesystem tree.
It is the admin's responsibility to make the files persistent.

To inspect the volumes run:
[source,docker]
----
docker volume ls | grep files
----

The volume name depends on the project name which builds the first part of the volume and the name of the volume in the docker file. The naming pattern of the volume is `<COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME>_<VOLUME_NAME>`. An environment variable for `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` can be set and also be defined in a `.env` file. If not specified, the directory in which docker-compose is executed will be used as a name.

To export the files of the project "owncloud-docker-server" as a tar archive run:
[source,docker]
----
docker run -v <YOUR_DOCKER_VOLUME>:/mnt \
       ubuntu tar cf - -C /mnt . > files.tar
----
====

[TIP]
====
Although the containers are up and running, it may still take a few minutes until ownCloud is fully
functional. +
To inspect the log output:
[source,docker]
----
docker-compose logs --follow owncloud
----
Wait until the output shows **Starting apache daemon...** before you access the web UI.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although all important data persists after:
[source,docker]
----
docker-compose down; docker-compose up -d
----
there are certain details that get lost, e.g., default apps may re-appear after they were uninstalled.
====

=== Logging In

To log in to the ownCloud UI, open `pass:a[http://localhost:{std-port-http}]` in your browser
of choice, where you see the standard ownCloud login screen as in the
image below.

image:docker/owncloud-ui-login.png[The ownCloud UI via Docker]

The username and password are the credentials which you stored in `.env` earlier.
Note that these will not change between deploys even if you change the values in .env.

=== Stopping the Containers

Again we assume you used `docker-compose` like in the previous example. +
To stop the containers use:
[source,docker]
----
docker-compose stop
----

To stop and remove containers along with the related networks, images and volumes:
[source,docker]
----
docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes
----

=== Running occ commands

If you want to run an occ command, first go to the directory where your `.yaml` or `.env` file is located.
Here, you are able to run any command referring to
xref:configuration/server/occ_command.adoc[Using the occ Command] by entering:

[source,docker]
----
docker-compose exec owncloud occ <command>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Don't use the `php` command prefix, this leads to several errors and is not intended to run in
docker environments.
====

=== Upgrading ownCloud on Docker

When a new version of ownCloud gets released, you should update your instance. To do so, follow
these simple steps:

. Go to your docker directory where your `.yaml` and `.env` files exist.
. Put ownCloud into maintenance mode with the following command:
+
[source,docker]
----
docker-compose exec owncloud occ maintenance:mode --on
----

. Create a backup of the database in case something goes wrong during the upgrade process, using the following command:
+
[source,docker]
----
docker-compose exec mariadb \
    /usr/bin/mysqldump \
    -u root \
    --password=owncloud \
    --single-transaction \
    owncloud > owncloud_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
----
+
NOTE: You need to adjust the password and database name if you have changed it in your deployment.

. Shutdown the containers:
+
[source,docker]
----
docker-compose down
----

. Update the version number of ownCloud in your `.env` file. You can use sed
for it, as in the following example.
+
Make sure that you adjust the example to match your installation.
+
[source,bash]
----
sed -i 's/^OWNCLOUD_VERSION=.*$/OWNCLOUD_VERSION=<newVersion>/' .env
----

. View the file to ensure the change has been implemented.
+
[source,bash]
----
cat .env
----

. Start your docker instance again.
+
[source,docker]
----
docker-compose up -d
----
+
Now you should have the current ownCloud running with `docker-compose`. Note that the container will
automatically run `occ upgrade` when starting up. If you notice the container starting over and over again,
you can check the update log with the following command:
+
[source,docker]
----
docker-compose logs --timestamp owncloud
----

. If all went well, end maintenance mode:
+
[source,docker]
----
docker-compose exec owncloud occ maintenance:mode --off
----

=== Docker Compose YAML File

The file `docker-compose.yml` contains the configuration of your ownCloud container.

[NOTE]
====
Since ownCloud Server 10.5, the dedicated enterprise docker image `registry.owncloud.com/owncloud/enterprise` is deprecated. All supported enterprise features and apps are now included in the public image `owncloud/server` available on Docker Hub. A login to our registry `registry.owncloud.com` is no longer required.
====

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$installation/docker/docker-compose.yml[Example Docker Compose YAML configuration file for ownCloud Server.]
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Admin Settings

When running under docker, the admin user cannot control certain settings in the WebUI, instead they are now controlled by environment variables. Changing these variables requires stopping and restarting the container with extra `docker -e ...` parameters or with new entries in the `.env` file for docker-compose.

==== Logging

The loglevel is set to the fixed value 2: _"Warnings, errors, and fatal issues"_.

.To get the highest log level "Everything" (including debug output), use:

[source,plaintext]
----
OWNCLOUD_LOGLEVEL=0
----

=== Raspberry Pi

If your container fails to start on Raspberry Pi or other ARM devices, you most likely have an old version of `libseccomp2` on your host. This should only affect distros based on Rasbian Buster 32 bit. Install a newer version with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
cd /tmp
wget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libs/libseccomp/libseccomp2_2.5.1-1_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i libseccomp2_2.5.1-1_armhf.deb
----

Alternatively you can add the backports repo for Debian Buster:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com \
     --recv-keys 04EE7237B7D453EC 648ACFD622F3D138
echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main" | \
     sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/buster-backports.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -t buster-backports libseccomp2
----

In any case, you should restart the container after confirming you have `libseccomp2.4.4` installed.

For more information see: {linux-server-doc-url}[Linux Server Docs]

=== Terminating containers

If your container is terminating for whatever reason, you will not be able to run `docker(-compose) exec` to make investigations inside the container as there will be no running container. Instead you need to use `docker(-compose) run`. It's important that you prefix any command to be run by `/usr/bin/owncloud`, otherwise the container will not be initialized correctly. See the example command below:

[source,bash]
----
docker(-compose) run <containername> /usr/bin/owncloud bash
----
